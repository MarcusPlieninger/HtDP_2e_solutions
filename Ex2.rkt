;;Exercise 2. Add the following two lines to the definitions area:
;(define prefix "hello")
;(define suffix "world")
;Then use string primitives to create an expression that concatenates prefix and suffix and adds "_" between them. When you run this program, you will see "hello_world" in the interactions area.

(define prefix "hello")
(define suffix "world")

(string-append prefix "_" suffix)
