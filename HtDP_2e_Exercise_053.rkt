; Exercise 53. The design recipe for world programs demands that you translate information into data
; and vice versa to ensure a complete understanding of the data definition. Itâ€™s best to draw some world
; scenarios and to represent them with data and, conversely, to pick some data examples
; and to draw pictures that match them. Do so for the LR definition, including at least HEIGHT and 0 as examples.

; Observation: relatively straightforward, refer to Prologue for sample scenarios.
; Scenarios: rocket at rest 0, rocket at midpoint height, rocket reaching full height HEIGHT
; Data examples; pick H slightly between rest and midpoint, pick H slightly between midpoint and full height

; Assumption: height is distance between top of canvas and reference point (i.e., center or rocket)
