;Exercise 38. Design the function string-remove-last,
;which produces a string like the given one with the last character removed.

;String->String
;given string strg, create a substring with character in last position omitted
;given: "string", expect: "strin"
;given: "batman", expect: "batma"
(define (string-remove-last strg)
  (substring strg 0 (- (string-length strg) 1)))
;;tests (i.e., functional examples)
