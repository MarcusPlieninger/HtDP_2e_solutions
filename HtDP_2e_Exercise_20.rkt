;Exercise 20. Define the function string-delete,
;which consumes a string plus a number i and deletes the ith position from str.
;Assume i is a number between 0 (inclusive) and the length of the given string (exclusive).
;See exercise 4 for ideas. Can string-delete deal with empty strings?

;(define (string-delete str i)
;  (if (or (= i 0) (< i (string-length str)));not assuming anything
;      (string-append (substring str 0 i) (substring str (+ i 1) (string-length str)))
;      "Error: Position indicated by i exceeds length of string."))

;String-delete cannot deal with empty strings. However, this can be changed by introducing
;an if expression that tests whether or not the string is identical to "".

(define (string-delete str i)
  (if (string=? str "")
      "Error: Empty string; no string to delete."
      (if (or (= i 0) (< i (string-length str)))
          (string-append (substring str 0 i) (substring str (+ i 1) (string-length str)))
          "Error: Position indicated by i exceeds length of string.")))
