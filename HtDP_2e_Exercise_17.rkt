;Exercise 17. Define the function image-classify, which consumes an image and conditionally
;produces "tall" if the image is taller than wide, "wide" if it is wider than tall, or "square"
;if its width and height are the same. See exercise 8 for ideas.

(define (classify img)
  (if (> (image-height img) (image-width img))
      "tall"
      (if (> (image-width img) (image-height img))
          "wide"
          (if (= (image-width img) (image-height img))
          "square"
          "error"))))
