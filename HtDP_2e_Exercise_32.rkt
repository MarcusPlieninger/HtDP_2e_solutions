;Exercise 32. Most people no longer use desktop computers just to run applications
;but also employ cell phones, tablets, and their carsâ€™ information control screen.
;Soon people will use wearable computers in the form of intelligent glasses, clothes,
;and sports gear. In the somewhat more distant future, people may come with built-in
;bio computers that directly interact with body functions.
;
;Think of ten different forms of events that software applications
;on such computers will have to deal with.
