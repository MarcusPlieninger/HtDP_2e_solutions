;Exercise 15. Define ==>. The function consumes two Boolean values, call them sunny and friday.
;Its answer is #true if sunny is false or friday is true.
;Note Logicians call this Boolean operation implication, and they use the notation sunny ==> friday for this purpose.

(define sunny #false)
(define friday #true)

(define (==> sunny friday)
  (or (not sunny) friday))

(==> sunny friday)

;Note: Look up the definition of "implication" and any associated truth table in The Elements of Logic.
