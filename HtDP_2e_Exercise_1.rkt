;Exercise 1.
;Add the following definitions for x and y to DrRacketâ€™s definitions area:
;(define x 3)
;(define y 4)
;Now imagine that x and y are the coordinates of a Cartesian point. Write down an expression that computes the distance of this point to the origin, that is, a point with the coordinates (0,0).
;The expected result for these values is 5, but your expression should produce the correct result even after you change these definitions.

(define x 3)
(define y 4)

(sqrt (+ (sqr x) (sqr y)))
