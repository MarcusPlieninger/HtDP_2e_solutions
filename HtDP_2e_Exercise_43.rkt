; Exercise 43. Let’s work through the same problem statement with a time-based data definition:

; An AnimationState is a Number.
; interpretation the number of clock ticks since the animation started

; Like the original data definition, this one also equates the states of the world with the class of numbers.
; Its interpretation, however, explains that the number means something entirely different.
; Design the functions tock and render. Then develop a big-bang expression so that once again you get an animation
; of a car traveling from left to right across the world’s canvas.

; How do you think this program relates to animate from Prologue: How to Program?
; The tick-expr function is called on the current state of the world every time the clock ticks. The result becomes
; the current world. The tick-expr function simply returns the number of clock ticks.
; The number of clock ticks is then used to compute the distance travelled per clock tick,
; which is velocity multiplied by time or three pixels per clock tick.
; Since the clock ticks 28 times per second, the car will travel 84 pixels per second.
; The render function will depict the growing distance as a result of accumulating clock tics.

; Use the data definition to design a program that moves the car according to a sine wave. (Don’t try to drive like that.)

; This program relates to animate from Prologue: How to Program? in the following way:

; This program is similar to animate.

; Animate starts a clock and counts the number of ticks.
; The clock ticks 28 times per second. Every time the clock ticks, animate applies the function
; picture-of-rocket to the current clock tick and the scene that this application creates is
; displayed on the canvas with the help of a distance function definition that returns the
; distance travelled at the current clock tick given a global physical constant definition for speed.

; This program uses the function tock to star a clock and count the number of ticks (i.e., "(+ as 1)").
; For each tick of the clock, big-bang obtains the next state of the world from tock by adding 1 to the
; current number of ticks. With the function named distance, the current number of ticks is used to compute
; the distance travelled at a given constant velocit at the current state, and render is used to obtain the
; image of the current state of the world.
;
; 

; use the data defintiion to design a program that moves the car according to a sine wave:
; Note: this will make the car movee forward and backward.
; The sine wave function will have to be incorporated into distance function.
